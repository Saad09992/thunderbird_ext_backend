Subject: Re: cost claims
Hello,
In the file, you can see an invoice numberâ€”could it be used as an identity code? I rechecked it, and this is what I found from OpenRouter.ai.

Subject: Re: Feedback on paper
Hi,

Thanks for the feedback. I will improve the paper based on the suggestions provided above. 

Yes, we shared the tool with all respondents along with the survey, and they all used the tool. Basically, we connected all the models through an API and integrated them into a single platform.
The replication package requires some formatting improvements, but I plan to upload it within the next one or two days and update the paper accordingly.
I will also think about how to incorporate an element of agility into the paper.

Subject: Re: Assignment detail
Hi,
I will create the non-technical assignments for this week, but you need to prepare the general assignment. For example, last week, Pekka created an assignment where students were required to interview a company about the AI tools they are using. You need to design a similar type of assignment and tasks for this week.
